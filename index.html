                Robots and Science fiction, two things that have been intertwined
                as science fiction has increased in its popularity throughout the
                past century. But, as technology and the integration of robots has
                increased the way we portray robots in science fiction has changed
                as well. We take a deep dive into the change of the approach that
                writers take to showcase robots in science fiction. To tell this
                story, we brought in different guests and even have a special
                interview with an archivist.
